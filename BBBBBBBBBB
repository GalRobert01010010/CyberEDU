# BBBBBBBBBB
- Challenge type: Forensics — Data Recovery / Obfuscation
- Goal: Repair a corrupted binary file by removing junk padding and extract hidden strings to decrypt the final archive.

## Commands:

sed 's/BBBBBBBBBB//g' chall.jpg > chall_repaired.jpg
- sed → stream editor for filtering and transforming text/binary data
- s/BBBBBBBBBB//g → substitute the string "BBBBBBBBBB" with nothing (delete) globally
- chall.jpg → the input file corrupted with junk "B" characters
- > → redirects the cleaned output to a new file
- Purpose: Restore the file's original structure by stripping the "B" character padding that prevented it from being recognized as a valid image.

convert chall_repaired.jpg -resize 800% -negate hint.png
- convert → ImageMagick tool for image manipulation
- -resize 800% → enlarges the image to make small or thin text legible
- -negate → inverts colors to increase contrast between text and background
- Purpose: Manually recover the password from the repaired banner image after automated OCR failed.

7z x chall-zip-in-zip.zip -p[TEXT_EXTRACTED]
- 7z x → extracts files from an archive with full paths
- -p → specifies the password (no space after the flag)
- Purpose: Use the string recovered from the image to unlock the final archive and obtain the flag.

#### Notes:
- **Magic Bytes:** If a file is unrecognized, check the hex header. A valid JPEG must start with `FF D8 FF`.
- **Binary Stream Editing:** `sed` on binary files is efficient for removing large-scale repetitive junk like the 'B' flood.
- **Visual Forensics:** Manual scaling and thresholding are required when images have extreme aspect ratios that confuse OCR tools.
